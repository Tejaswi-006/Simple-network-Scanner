Network Scanner with Scapy
Overview
This Python project implements a simple network scanner using the Scapy library. The scanner performs an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) scan on a specified target IP address or IP range, identifying active devices on the local network.

Prerequisites
Python 3
Scapy library (pip install scapy)


Explanation
The script utilizes the Scapy library to construct ARP requests, send them as broadcast frames, and collect responses from devices on the local network. The results include the IP and MAC addresses of active devices.

Note: Ensure that you have the right to scan and monitor the network. Unauthorized scanning may violate ethical and legal standards.
